# camera-calculations
A Python script for calculating the intersection of the camera view rectangle with LiDAR point data.

This is just a starting point, as the actual working implementation would require the use of much more complex matrix algebra.

The code in this file is merely an attempt at converting the three-dimensional point data into a two-dimensional image using multivariable calculus.
